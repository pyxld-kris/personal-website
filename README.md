# Hi there!

It looks like you found some code that runs my personal website. There's a few neat things in here that I'd like to extract at some point in the future, and I figured I'd throw it on here in case someone finds something fun they can do with it in the interim. You can see it live at https://krisgano.com.

This project combines React, Graphology, and Cytoscape together alongside a markdown renderer to allow for some fun data visualization/exploration. Currently, the cytoscape and graphology components have been broken off into separate hooks that allow them to interact with React in a semi-organized way. The intention is to decouple the system away from the content I've populated it with and make things more re-usable, and throw all of that into a neat little package. Some day, maybe.

For now... Hello, nice to meet you. Hope you enjoy getting to know me a bit :)
