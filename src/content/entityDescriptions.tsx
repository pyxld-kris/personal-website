# Hi, I'm Kris  
#### I love making cool stuff (like this website!)

*A little backstory on the site: While working on a project heavily intwined with AI, I dove into the concept of "Knowledge Graphs". That deep dive became the data visualization/exploration tool this site is running on, which I've employed here to showcase my professional life in different ways.*

### About Me

I start things, I run things, I do a lot! Some of the things I do include: building systems, modeling businesses and software, working with video games, leveraging a variety of mediums to tell stories and sell ideas, creating products focused on users, consulting on tech/organizational decisions for businesses, and getting down and dirty with code. In a nutshell, I love making ideas happen and continue to work hard to grow the skills needed to do so!

I've set out to help as many people as I can while building awesome stuff. My life is good.

  Krafties: `
# Krafties
Krafties is a fantasy themed, pet based, massively multiplayer online game(aka MMO). I've defined and worked with just about every aspect of the business, including:
- Business development and execution
- Project/product management
- Content release programming
- All levels of technical planning and development
  - Web app/front end development
  - Building out our multi server architecture (database, cache, app, and socket servers)
  - Developing and integrating plugins/changes in existing programs to speed up our content creation flows
  - Much more... 
- 3D modeling/texturing (All of the creatures in the included images were modeled and textured by me, environment objects were created by various designers)
- Managing our creative pipeline to allow for higher fidelity deliverables within shorter time frames
- Game design
  - Combat system design
  - Economic design 
    - Managed an economy of virtual goods which people buy and sell for real world money, and have had millions of USD change hands through our system. I work to ensure that items retain relative value while accounting for early and late stage game progression, power creep, our ability to continue adding new content, and a multitude of other factors. 
- Lots more to add here

  Heartstrings: `
# Heartstrings
Global Heartstrings was a short lived web app intended to gamify donating to various social and environmental causes across the globe. It used Google Earth to display the world in 3D, and white strings (starting at a donators' locations and ending at non-profits' locations or areas they're helping) to represent donations. The end goal: wrap the world in string!
